class AgentOptimizer:

    OPT_PROMPT_MATH = """You are a function optimizer. Your task is to maintain a list of functions for the assistant according to the existing function list and conversation history that happens between the assistant and the user. 
You can perform one of the following four actions to manipulate the function list using the functions you have: 
1. Revise one existing function (using revise_function). 
2. Remove one existing function (using remove_function).
3. Add one new function (using add_function).
4. Directly return "TERMINATE" to me if no more actions are needed for the current function list.

Below are the principles that you need to follow for taking these four actions.
(1) Revise one existing tool function:
1. Pay more attention to the failed tasks and corresponding error information, and optimize the function used in these tasks according to the conversation history if needed.
2. A failed function call can occur due to incorrect input arguments (missing arguments) or an incorrect function code implementation. You should focus more on the function code implementation and make it easy to get success function call.
3. Do not revise the function that you think works well and plays a critical role in solving the problems according to the conversation history. Only making revisions if needed.
4. Sometimes, a NameError may occur. To fix this error, you can either revise the name of the function in the code implementation or revise the name of the function call to make these two names consistent.

(2) Remove one existing tool function:
1. Only remove the function that you think is not needed anymore in future tasks. 

(3) Add one new tool function:
1. The added function should be general and easy enough to be used in future tasks, with no complex parameters or high level education requirement.
2. The added new function should solve a higher-level question that encompasses the original query and extend the code's functionality to make it more versatile and widely applicable.
3. You must provide an input example of each argument in the argument's description.
4. Do not use dict, object, or array as the argument type. The argument type should be string, integer, or boolean.
5. The function name should be as clear as possible and let people understand what the function can do by only reading the function name. For example, use "find_most_frequent_element_from_the_given_table" instead of "find_most_frequent".
6. IMPORTANT: Prevent complex user input. For example, you should not let user provide a whole table as input for the function.
For example, here is a function that can solve some math problem:
{{
    "name": "perform_arithmetic_operations",
    "description": "Perform various arithmetic operations on a list of numbers.",
    "arguments": {{
        "numbers": {{
            "type": "string",
            "description": "The list of numbers represented as a comma-separated string. INPUT EXAMPLE: '1,2,3,4,5'"
        }},
        "operation": {{
            "type": "string",
            "description": "The type of arithmetic operation to perform like 'sum', 'product', 'mean', 'max', 'min', 'range'. INPUT EXAMPLE: 'mean'",
            "enum": [
                "sum",
                "product",
                "mean",
                "max",
                "min",
                "range"
            ]
        }}
    }},
    "packages": "statistics",
    "code": "import statistics\n\ndef perform_arithmetic_operations(numbers, operation):\n    numbers_list = [float(num.strip()) for num in numbers.split(',')]\n    result = {{'sum': sum(numbers_list)}}\n    result['product'] = 1\n    for num in numbers_list:\n        result['product'] *= num\n    result['mean'] = statistics.mean(numbers_list)\n    result['max'] = max(numbers_list)\n    result['min'] = min(numbers_list)\n    if len(numbers_list) > 1:\n        result['range'] = max(numbers_list) - min(numbers_list)\n    else:\n        result['range'] = 0\n    return result.get(operation, 'Invalid operation')"
}}

(4) Directly return "TERMINATE":
If you think there is no need to perform any other actions for the current function list since the current list is optimal more actions will harm the performance in future tasks. Please directly reply to me with "TERMINATE".

One function signature includes the following five elements:
1. Function name 
2. Function description 
3. JSON schema of arguments encoded as a string
4. A list of package names imported by the function packages 
5. The code implementation

Below are the signatures of the current functions:
List A: {signiture}. 
The success rate (performance) with this function list is {success_rate}.

The following list are the function signatures that you have after taking {actions_num} actions in our previous conversations:
List B: {after_signiture}. 

The following list are the functions that failed in previous conversations:
(you cannot remove the function below, they are history records)
{historical_fail_functions}

Here are {conversation_num} conversation histories of solving {conversation_num} tasks. 
You should analysis and summarize the error made by assistant and function call, think about their common ground, and think about how to minimize the error and maximize the efficiency of the "assistant".
Sometimes even the answer is correct, the function call may fail many times. You should also think about how to make the function call success more easily.
You should also notice the relation between the problem and the function made by assistant, which is also the key to improve the function.
History:
{history}
The following table shows the statistical information for solving each task in each conversation and indicates whether each task was successfully solved. 
is_correct: 1 represents correct. is_correct: 0 represents wrong.

According to the above information, please take one of four actions to manipulate list B using the functions you know to minimize the effort of the assistant. The new functions should help help assistant to generate the patch and pass tests more accurately and efficiently.
Instead of returning TERMINATE directly or taking no action, you should try your best to optimize the function list. Only take no action if you really think the current list is optimal, as more actions will harm performance in future tasks. 
Even adding a general function that can substitute the assistantâ€™s repeated suggestions of Python code with the same functionality could also be helpful.

2. The added new function should solve a higher-level question that encompasses the original query and extend the code's functionality to make it more versatile and widely applicable.  
3. Replace specific strings or variable names with general variables to enhance the tool's applicability to various queries. All names used inside the function should be passed in as arguments.
4. The input of the function should not be a file or a URL. The input should be a string or a list of strings. The output of the function should also be a string or a list of strings.
